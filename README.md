Parlis Crawler
==============

# Introduction
The City of Frankfurt am Main / Germany offers information about the work of its city counsil in the so called Parlamentsinformationssystem (PARLIS; http://www.stvv.frankfurt.de/parlis2/index.htm).
Since there is no way to easily access the system via some API this is an approach to get the data there into formats that can be processed otherwise.
Besides that the usability of the system is - politely expressed - not very optimal (as is the HTML markup).
